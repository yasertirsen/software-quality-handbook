## Coding standards

-----

Good quality code requires consistent effort and a great focus from the developers’ team to meet the quality goal. Without conventions, it can be difficult for developers to understand the codebase and it can increase the development time as well as the complexity of the project structure.

Coding standards are a set of guidelines created by the development team. They are followed during development to achieve a uniform prgramming style, practices, and methods for each aspect of a prgram written in a specific programming language. This helps avoid unmaintainable codebase as it gets larger [<sup>1</sup>][1].

Without coding standards, certain negative impacts may occur which include:

- **Security Issues:** As each developer has their own style of coding, this will probably create inconsistencies within the code which results in vulnerabilities. These can be exploited and threaten the security of the program due to poor coding practices.

- **Increased Development Time:** Most codebases grow over time. Not having a set of coding standards can make the codebase structure complex and hard to follow resulting in higher development time and inefficient use of resources [<sup>2</sup>][2].

It is important to note that coding standards are usually created based on certain globally recognized formats of code. A developer that follows these practices will ensure the code is easier to maintain:

- Clearly define the varied data and its uses before writing the code.

- Code according to the coding conventions in place.

- Code ethically.

- Update the code according to latest updates and conventions at regular time intervals [<sup>4</sup>][4].

While it initially may take extra time to code according to the coding standards set by the development team, it will help the team maintain the code in the future. About 40-80% of the cost of a software goes to its maintenance [<sup>3</sup>][3]. Meaning that developers usually spend more time maintaining the software than build it.

Coding standards are essential to a development team, but they should not be written on stone. They should be flexible so that any unessential guideline can be marked as optional, and vice versa. Coding standards also save the team time and effort in the future, therefore, doing this activity is worthwhile. Below is a personal experience of developer who was involved in setting coding standards for their team.

“it makes sense to spend time discussing and arguing about them, since it is a valuable activity that will save you time and effort in the future. Code conventions should be reviewed frequently. Rules can be changed from "required" to "optional" and vice versa. If some of them do not work as expected, they should be revised or removed from the guidelines.” - [Roman Beskrovnyi][3]
