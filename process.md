# Project Plan

Topics we need to research:

- Task estimation in Scrum - Liam
- Coding standards - Yaser
- Code reviews - Adam

We should split the research, one topic for each person, then we can rotate so that at least 2 people can contribute to the topic.

Once done with researching the topic, leave a source or two for the next person to write more about the topic.
If the sources are scarce, add bullet points of what you think should be added.

## Coding Standards Notes

Notes for next person:

- I added this [source](https://www.multidots.com/importance-of-code-quality-and-coding-standard-in-software-development/), it has good info about advantages of coding standards which you can use. It is number 5 in the references.

## Code Reviews Notes

- [this](https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/387-10-ways-to-improve-your-code-proven-through-personal-experience) includes a personal experience about code reviews
